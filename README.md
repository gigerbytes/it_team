# How to Use Git

Git is a programme that allows us to easily manage our code.

1. If you have a new repository

`git clone <repository name>`

2. If you want to update your repository

`git pull`

3. If you want to submit your changes - run the following code

```
git add .
git commit -m "your message"`
git push`
```
